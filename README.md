HKGKT: A Multi-Approach Knowledge Tracing Model for Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph

Knowledge tracing (KT) is a key technique which models students’ knowledge state and predicts their performance in solving new questions. For one subject, questions are always associated with specific concepts, and there are various relations between these concepts, which can provide important information for knowledge tracing. However, the previous works usually concentrate on dealing with only one kind of relation rather than a heterogeneous graph, which limits the performance of these models. To address this issue, we propose a model called Knowledge Tracing based on Heterogeneous Knowledge Graph (HKGKT), which utilizes both relational graph convolutional networks (R-GCN) and proper regularization terms to represent more details of the knowledge graph, and then make prediction based on the concepts and difficulty-levels of questions. Besides, HKGKT can explicitly generalize students’ mastery of every concept, which makes its outputs more reliable and explicable. In order to evaluate this model, we test it on three real world datasets in the field of education, and the experiments demonstrate that HKGKT achieves better performance and stability compared to other baseline models.

Make sure you have CUDA, or possible errors may happen!!

We will continue to update it.
